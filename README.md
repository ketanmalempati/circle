# Circle Explainable AI application

## Introduction

This is an application that aims to educate users about the most influential factors in a dataset when it is trained to predict a certain variable's outcome. 
It allows users to understand what the machine learning model believes to be the most affecting factors in a given dataset.

There are some pre-trained models that demonstrate this feature and visualizations are generated to help understand these factors.
